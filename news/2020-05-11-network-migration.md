We are taking a big step to improve the connectivity of the AWS environments within AWS and with the Air Liquide internal network. As tracked in our [public roadmap](https://git.apps.airliquide.com/GIO/OS/CEC/aws-roadmap/-/issues/2) we're now rolling out the implementation of the Transit Gateway for the AWS Landing Zone for EMEA.  

Every account owner will be contacted for this migration. Check the Network Integration [Network Integration section](https://tech-guides.apps.airliquide.com/docs/cs/aws-lab-essential/architecture-and-concepts/network/) of the documentation to know more.
